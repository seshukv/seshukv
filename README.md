### Hi there, I'm Seshu Kumar Vungarala ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! 

I am a Vancouver-based data enthusiast with a post-degree diploma in Data Analytics and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Alongside my 3 years of experience as a Systems Analyst at TATA Consultancy Services, I have also gained invaluable insights as a Research Assistant at Langara College and as a Data Analyst at HeadCheck, a Vancouver-based company. As a blogger on Medium, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and insights on various data science-related topics.
