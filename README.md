### Hi there, I'm Seshu Kumar Vungarala ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a Vancouver-based data enthusiast with a post-degree diploma in Data Analytics and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With over three years of experience as a Systems Analyst at TATA Consultancy Services, as well as research assistant and data analyst roles at Langara College and HeadCheck, I have developed a passion for finding trends and using Machine Learning models to derive insights.
